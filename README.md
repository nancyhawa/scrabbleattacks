## Rules:

- All tiles are flipped over at the beginning
- Players take turns, flipping over one tile at a time
- If there is a word of 4 or more letters in the overturned tiles, a player can shout it out to
  claim it
- Also, if a player can add an overturned title to an existing word or combine two existing words to
  make a new word,
- You can't just add an `S`, `D`, or `R` to the end of a word
- Once tiles are in a word, they can't be removed, although they can be rearranged within that word
  or combined with other tiles or words
- The last person to claim a word has the next turn
- It doesn't have to be your turn to claim a word
- Your score is the scrabble point value of all the words you've claimed

UI:

- 3 columns

| player 1 | tiles | player 2 |
